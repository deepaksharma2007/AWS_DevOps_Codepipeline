 # AWS_DevOps_Codepipeline Project 

## Overview of the Workflow
**1. Source Control Management (SCM) with AWS CodeCommit:** We use CodeCommit to store and manage our application code.

**2. Building Docker Images with AWS CodeBuild:** CodeBuild automates the creation of Docker images by compiling the application code stored in CodeCommit. It also provides a build server to execute the build process.

**3. Publishing Docker Images to Docker Hub:** Once the Docker image is built, CodeBuild publishes it to our Docker Hub account, making it available for deployment.

**4. Deploying with AWS CodeDeploy:** We utilize the Docker image stored on Docker Hub in our deployment process. CodeDeploy handles the deployment of the image to EC2 instances.

**5. Accessing the Application:** Clients can connect to the application via the public IP address of the EC2 instance, allowing them to interact with the deployed service seamlessly.

 # Detailed Explanation of the CI/CD Workflow
## 1. Source Control Management (SCM) with AWS CodeCommit:

- **Purpose:**-  AWS CodeCommit is a fully managed source control service that hosts Git repositories. It serves as the SCM for the project, allowing developers to store, manage, and version control their application code securely.

- **Setup:** You create a CodeCommit repository to hold your application's code. Developers can clone the repository, make changes, and push updates back to CodeCommit. This enables collaboration and tracking of code changes.

## 2. Building Docker Images with AWS CodeBuild:

- **Purpose:** AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service that automates the compilation of source code, running tests, and creating deployable software packages. In this workflow, CodeBuild is responsible for building the Docker image that encapsulates the application code.

-  **Process:**
  
     **1. Build Configuration:** You create a build specification file (buildspec.yml) that defines the build commands, including installing dependencies, packaging the application, and building the Docker image.

     **2. Execution Environment:** CodeBuild provides a build server where the build process runs. This environment is pre-configured with the necessary tools to compile and package the application.

     **3. image Creation:** CodeBuild executes the build commands, which include creating a Docker image with the application code deployed inside it.


## 3. Publishing the Docker Image to Docker Hub:
- **Purpose:** After the Docker image is built, it needs to be stored in a container registry for later use. Docker Hub serves as the repository for storing Docker images.
  
- **Process:**
  
    **1. Docker Login:** CodeBuild logs into your Docker Hub account using credentials stored securely, often in AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Parameter Store.
  
     **2. Image Upload:** The built Docker image is pushed to your Docker Hub account, making it accessible for deployment.
 
## 4. Deployment with AWS CodeDeploy:

-  **Purpose:** AWS CodeDeploy automates the deployment of the application, ensuring that the latest Docker image is deployed to the designated environment (e.g., EC2 instances).
  
-  **Process:**
   
     **1. Application Specification:** You create an appspec.yml file that defines the deployment instructions, such as stopping existing services, pulling the latest Docker image from Docker Hub, and starting the new container.
   
     **2. Deployment Group:** You configure a deployment group in CodeDeploy, targeting specific EC2 instances where the application should be deployed.

## 5. Launching the Application:

- **Final Step:** Once CodeDeploy completes the deployment, the application is running on the EC2 instance. Clients can connect to the application using the public IP address of the EC2 instance.

- **Accessibility:** By using the public IP, users can access the application through a web browser or any client that interacts with the application, enabling seamless use of the deployed service.

# Conclusion
This repository showcases a robust CI/CD pipeline using AWS services to automate the entire process of building, publishing, and deploying Docker images. By integrating AWS CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy, the workflow ensures that any changes to the application code in the SCM automatically trigger the build and deployment process. This automation not only saves time but also enhances the reliability and consistency of application deployments, allowing teams to focus on development rather than manual deployment tasks.
