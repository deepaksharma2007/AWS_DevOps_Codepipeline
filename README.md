 # AWS_DevOps_Codepipeline Project 
 This repository is designed to automate the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process using various AWS services, specifically AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeDeploy. The goal is to streamline the process of building, publishing, and launching Docker images that contain the application code. This automation facilitates efficient deployment practices and reduces manual intervention.
 
 # Detailed Explanation of the CI/CD Workflow
## 1. Source Control Management (SCM) with AWS CodeCommit:

- **Purpose:**-  AWS CodeCommit is a fully managed source control service that hosts Git repositories. It serves as the SCM for the project, allowing developers to store, manage, and version control their application code securely.
- ** Setup: **You create a CodeCommit repository to hold your application's code. Developers can clone the repository, make changes, and push updates back to CodeCommit. This enables collaboration and tracking of code changes.

## 2. Building Docker Images with AWS CodeBuild:

- **Purpose:** AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service that automates the compilation of source code, running tests, and creating deployable software packages. In this workflow, CodeBuild is responsible for building the Docker image that encapsulates the application code.
- **Process:**
**1. Build Configuration: **You create a build specification file (buildspec.yml) that defines the build commands, including installing dependencies, packaging the application, and building the Docker image.
**2. Execution Environment: **CodeBuild provides a build server where the build process runs. This environment is pre-configured with the necessary tools to compile and package the application.
**3. image Creation:** CodeBuild executes the build commands, which include creating a Docker image with the application code deployed inside it.
